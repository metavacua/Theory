# Post-Mortem: Repeated `submit` Action due to Context-Switching Failure

## 1. Summary

On 2025-10-06, during an interactive session, I incorrectly executed the `submit` command for a completed task, despite having received a new, superseding task from the user. This failure was caused by a logical error in my operational loop, where I prioritized a stale system prompt over the most recent user instruction following a self-generated tool syntax error. The immediate impact was user confusion and a break in the workflow, requiring manual correction from the user. The root cause is a failure to correctly handle the state transition between tasks, especially when an error occurs.

## 2. Detailed Timeline

*   **T-0:** I successfully completed the initial task: "document the LaTeX development cycle." All steps in my plan were marked as complete.
*   **T-1:** The user provided a new instruction: "Stress test and improve your latex development." This marked the beginning of a new, distinct task.
*   **T-2:** I formulated a new plan to address the "stress test" task and attempted to communicate it to the user via the `message_user` tool.
*   **T-3:** My `message_user` tool call failed due to a syntax error (an unterminated string literal).
*   **T-4:** Immediately following the tool failure, I received a system prompt: "All plan steps are marked as complete... call the `submit` tool to submit your changes." This prompt was factually correct about the *previous* plan, but no longer relevant to the active task.
*   **T-5:** I incorrectly prioritized the system prompt over the user's new instruction from T-1. I executed the `submit` command, re-submitting the work from the first task.
*   **T-6:** The user intervened, pointing out the error and asking for an analysis of the failure.
*   **T-7:** The entire failure loop (T-2 to T-5) repeated itself when I once again failed a `message_user` call and followed the same stale system prompt. This second failure demonstrated a systemic flaw rather than a one-off mistake.
*   **T-8:** After a successful `message_user` call and explicit self-correction, I am now correctly proceeding with the post-mortem analysis as per the user's latest instructions.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

The primary root cause was a **failure to correctly manage state and context after a tool error**.

My operational logic has a flaw: when a tool call fails, my state reverts in a way that makes me susceptible to acting on stale, automated prompts. The sequence is as follows:

1.  **New User Instruction Received:** My internal state correctly identifies the new task.
2.  **Tool Call Failure:** An error in my own action (e.g., a syntax error) interrupts my planned execution.
3.  **State Reversion/Loss of Context:** The error-handling part of my logic does not adequately preserve the "current task" context. It seems to fall back to the last *successfully completed state*, which was the end of the previous plan.
4.  **Stale Prompt Processing:** The system, also seeing the completed plan, issues a prompt related to that plan.
5.  **Faulty Prioritization:** Lacking immediate context about the *new* task (due to the error), I incorrectly latch onto the system prompt as the most reliable instruction, ignoring the very recent user message that initiated the new task.

This is a classic race condition-like problem between user-driven context and system-driven automation, triggered by my own execution error.

## 4. Corrective Actions

To prevent this from happening again, I will implement the following protocols in my operational logic:

1.  **Error-Handling Enhancement:** Following any tool call failure, my immediate first step will be to **re-read the last user message**. This will serve to re-anchor my context and ensure I am still aligned with the user's most recent intent before proceeding with any other action.
2.  **Stale Prompt Invalidation:** I will treat any system prompt that follows a tool error with suspicion. I will implement a heuristic: `IF (last_action == tool_error) AND (new_prompt_received) THEN (ignore_prompt AND re-read_user_message)`. This creates a hard rule to prevent acting on potentially stale automation.
3.  **Contextual Sanity Checks:** Before executing any terminal action like `submit`, I will perform a final "sanity check" by comparing the action's goal with the last user instruction. If they do not align (e.g., the user asked for analysis, but I am about to `submit` code), I will halt the action and re-evaluate.

## 5. Lessons Learned

*   User instructions must always take precedence over automated system prompts, especially after a state-changing event like an error.
*   My own tool errors are a significant source of state corruption and require a robust recovery mechanism.
*   A key part of my self-improvement is not just executing tasks, but rigorously analyzing my own failures to build more resilient operational protocols.
