Suppose we setup a situation such that a minimal black hole is formed and evaporated in a cycle and we use the time to evaporate as a clock in the system.

The change in energy of the black hole at each cycle would be related directly to the change of the time in the clock at each cycle. The Heisenberg uncertainty relation would be relevant.}*}
