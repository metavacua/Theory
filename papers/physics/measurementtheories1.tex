	\begin{abstract}
		This document outlines a theoretical framework for classifying physical measurement processes based on their inherent reversibility concerning system states. We distinguish between irreversible (classical) measurements, which obscure past state information, and reversible (non-classical) measurements, which preserve pathways to infer prior states. This framework is extended by introducing the concepts of classically and non-classically accessible and inaccessible information, linking the nature of the measurement process directly to the type and scope of information obtainable about the system.

	\section{Introduction}
	The act of measurement is fundamental to all empirical science, yet its theoretical description, particularly the transition from potentiality to actuality (e.g., quantum state reduction), remains a subject of deep inquiry. Standard descriptions often focus on the outcomes and the probabilities thereof. Here, we propose a complementary classification based on the \emph{reversibility} of the measurement process with respect to the system's state trajectory and the associated \emph{accessibility} of information. We define two idealized classes: classical (irreversible) and non-classical (reversible) measurements, and explore the types of information revealed or obscured by each.
	
	\section{Foundational Concepts}
	
	\begin{definition}[System State]
		The \emph{state} of a physical system, denoted $S(t)$, provides a complete description of the system at time $t$. It belongs to a state space $\SystemState$. Examples include points in phase space $(q,p)$ for classical mechanics, or state vectors $\ket{\psi(t)}$ or density operators $\rho(t)$ in Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ for quantum mechanics.
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{definition}[Measurement Process]
		A measurement involves three components:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The \emph{System} (S) under investigation.
			\item The \emph{Measurement Apparatus} (A), interacting with S.
			\item The \emph{Interaction} ($\Interaction$), a physical process coupling S and A over a time interval $[\TimePre, \TimePost]$.
		\end{enumerate}
		The process yields a \emph{Measurement Outcome} ($\OutcomeVal$), which is an element from a set of possible outcomes $\Outcome$, registered by A at $\TimePost$. The state of the system transitions from $\StatePre$ to $\StatePost$.
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{definition}[State Reversibility]
		A measurement process is considered \emph{state-reversible} if knowledge of the post-measurement state $\StatePost$ and the outcome $\OutcomeVal$ (and potentially the final state of the apparatus $A(\TimePost)$) allows, in principle, for the unique determination or inference of the pre-measurement state $\StatePre$. Conversely, it is \emph{state-irreversible} if multiple distinct pre-measurement states $\StatePre$ could lead to the same pair $\{\StatePost, \OutcomeVal\}$.
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{definition}[System Information]
		\emph{Information} ($\Info$) refers to the quantitative or qualitative properties derivable from the system state $S(t)$. This can include expectation values of observables $\expval{\hat{O}}$, probability distributions of physical quantities, correlation measures, entanglement entropy, etc. $\Info(S(t))$ denotes the set of information extractable from state $S(t)$.
	\end{definition}
	
	
	\section{Postulates of Measurement Reversibility}
	
	\begin{postulate}[Classical Measurement: Irreversibility] \label{post:classical}
		A \emph{classical measurement} is characterized by an interaction $\Interaction_C$ that is fundamentally state-irreversible.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Information Loss:} The mapping from $\StatePre$ to $\{\StatePost, \OutcomeVal\}$ is many-to-one. Information pertaining to certain degrees of freedom or properties present in $\StatePre$ is lost or made inaccessible by the measurement process itself.
			\item \textbf{Past State Obscurity:} Unique determination of $\StatePre$ from $\StatePost$ and $\OutcomeVal$ is impossible.
			\item \textbf{Future State Limitation:} The information loss during interaction may inherently limit the precision with which future states $S(t > \TimePost)$ can be predicted, beyond the limitations imposed by the system's intrinsic dynamics.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{postulate}
	
	\begin{example}[Classical Measurement]
		Measuring the position of a particle with high precision inevitably and uncontrollably alters its momentum, rendering the pre-measurement momentum state inaccessible from the position outcome. An ideal von Neumann (projective) measurement in quantum mechanics projects the state vector onto an eigenstate, losing information about the superposition coefficients present before the measurement.
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{postulate}[Non-Classical Measurement: Reversibility] \label{post:nonclassical}
		A \emph{non-classical measurement} is characterized by an interaction $\Interaction_{NC}$ that is, ideally or in principle, state-reversible.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Information Preservation:} The interaction is designed such that the essential information required to reconstruct $\StatePre$ is preserved, potentially within the combined system-apparatus state or encoded in the precise relationship between $\StatePost$ and $\OutcomeVal$.
			\item \textbf{Past State Inferrability:} Unique determination or inference of $\StatePre$ from $\StatePost$, $\OutcomeVal$, and potentially $A(\TimePost)$ is possible in principle.
			\item \textbf{Future State Predictability:} The measurement ideally minimizes disturbance to the system properties relevant for future evolution, allowing predictability limited primarily by the system's intrinsic dynamics (e.g., Schr\"{o}dinger evolution, possibly conditioned on $\OutcomeVal$).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{postulate}
	
	\begin{example}[Non-Classical Measurement]
		Ideal Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) measurements aim to measure an observable without affecting its subsequent evolution or disturbing conjugate observables. Weak measurements extract minimal information per interaction but disturb the state only slightly, allowing statistical reconstruction of $\StatePre$ over ensembles. A fully unitary interaction tracked on the combined system-apparatus Hilbert space represents the ideal limit.
	\end{example}
	
	
	\section{Principles of Information Accessibility}
	
	Building upon the reversibility postulates, we define types of information based on their accessibility via these measurement classes.
	
	\begin{principle}[Classically Accessible Information (CAI)] \label{princ:CAI}
		Information $\Info_{CA} \subseteq \Info(S)$ is \emph{classically accessible} if it can be obtained as, or directly inferred from, the outcome $\OutcomeVal_C$ of a classical (irreversible) measurement process (Postulate \ref{post:classical}).
	\end{principle}
	\begin{remark}
		Accessing CAI typically implies rendering other information inaccessible due to the measurement's irreversible nature.
	\end{remark}
	
	\begin{principle}[Classically Inaccessible Information (CII)] \label{princ:CII}
		Information $\Info_{CI} \subseteq \Info(S)$ is \emph{classically inaccessible} if it pertains to aspects of the state $\StatePre$ or future states $S(t > \TimePost)$ that cannot be determined or inferred following a classical measurement yielding outcome $\OutcomeVal_C$ from state $\StatePost$, due to the information loss inherent in the irreversible interaction $\Interaction_C$.
	\end{principle}
	\begin{example}
		In a projective measurement of spin-z ($S_z$), the pre-measurement information about $S_x$ or $S_y$ becomes CII.
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{principle}[Non-Classically Accessible Information (NCAI)] \label{princ:NCAI}
		Information $\Info_{NCA} \subseteq \Info(S)$ is \emph{non-classically accessible} if it can be obtained as, or inferred from, the outcome $\OutcomeVal_{NC}$ and post-measurement state $\StatePost$ (and potentially $A(\TimePost)$) resulting from a non-classical (reversible) measurement process (Postulate \ref{post:nonclassical}).
	\end{principle}
	\begin{remark}
		NCAI may include information that is also CAI, but non-classical measurements offer pathways to access information that would otherwise become CII if probed classically.
	\end{remark}
	
	\begin{principle}[Strictly Non-Classically Accessible Information (SNCAI)] \label{princ:SNCAI}
		Information $\Info_{SNCA} \subseteq \Info(S)$ is \emph{strictly non-classically accessible} if it is Non-Classically Accessible ($\Info_{SNCA} \subseteq \Info_{NCA}$) but \emph{not} Classically Accessible ($\Info_{SNCA} \cap \Info_{CA} = \emptyset$). This represents information that can only be obtained via measurement protocols that preserve state reversibility.
	\end{principle}
	\begin{example}
		Information about delicate quantum correlations or superposition coefficients that would be destroyed by a projective (classical) measurement might be SNCAI, accessible only through weak or QND measurements. The full information required to reconstruct $\StatePre$ after a non-classical measurement is, by definition, SNCAI if the measurement yielded information that would have been obscured classically.
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{principle}[Fundamentally Inaccessible Information (FII)] \label{princ:FII}
		Certain information might be considered \emph{fundamentally inaccessible}, regardless of the measurement type, due to inherent limitations of the physical theory itself (e.g., information precluded by the uncertainty principle, information beyond the cosmological horizon). This category is distinct from CII, which arises specifically from the nature of classical measurements.
	\end{principle}
	
	
	\section{Relationship between Reversibility and Accessibility}
	
	The core thesis is the intimate link between the reversibility of the measurement process and the nature of the information it yields:
	
	\begin{proposition}
		Classical (irreversible) measurements provide access to CAI at the cost of rendering other potentially relevant information into CII. The process inherently involves an entropy increase associated with information loss about the system's microstate.
	\end{proposition}
	
	\begin{proposition}
		Non-classical (reversible) measurements provide access to NCAI, potentially including SNCAI. They aim to minimize the generation of CII by preserving pathways to infer the pre-measurement state and predict future evolution, ideally involving minimal entropy increase in the system itself (though entropy may increase in the combined system-apparatus-environment).
	\end{proposition}
	
	
	\section{Mathematical Framework Sketch}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Classical Measurement:} Often modeled using projection operators $\hat{P}_i$ corresponding to outcomes $i$. $\rho(\TimePre) \rightarrow \rho(\TimePost) = \frac{\hat{P}_i \rho(\TimePre) \hat{P}_i}{\Tr(\hat{P}_i \rho(\TimePre))}$. This is non-unitary and irreversible. Information loss can be quantified using entropy changes (e.g., von Neumann entropy).
		\item \textbf{Non-Classical Measurement:} Can be modeled by unitary evolution $\hat{U}$ on the combined system-apparatus Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_S \otimes \mathcal{H}_A$. $\ket{\psi(\TimePre)}_S \otimes \ket{\phi_0}_A \rightarrow \hat{U} (\ket{\psi(\TimePre)}_S \otimes \ket{\phi_0}_A) = \sum_i \ket{\psi_i(\TimePost)}_S \otimes \ket{\phi_i}_A$. Measurement corresponds to projecting A onto $\ket{\phi_i}_A$, leaving S in state $\ket{\psi_i(\TimePost)}_S$. If $\hat{U}$ and $\ket{\phi_i}_A$ are known, and the mapping is appropriate, $\ket{\psi(\TimePre)}_S$ might be reconstructed. Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) $\{ \hat{E}_i \}$ where $\sum_i \hat{E}_i^\dagger \hat{E}_i = \mathbb{I}$ provide a general framework. The post-measurement state depends on the specific form of the POVM elements $\hat{M}_i$ ($\hat{E}_i = \hat{M}_i^\dagger \hat{M}_i$). Certain POVMs correspond to weak or reversible measurements.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	
	This theoretical framework categorizes measurements based on state reversibility, linking this property directly to the accessibility of information. Classical measurements are irreversible and yield Classically Accessible Information (CAI) while generating Classically Inaccessible Information (CII). Non-classical measurements are ideally reversible, yielding Non-Classically Accessible Information (NCAI), including potentially Strictly Non-Classically Accessible Information (SNCAI), while minimizing CII. This perspective offers a valuable lens for analyzing measurement in diverse physical contexts, particularly in quantum information and foundations where the nature of measurement and information extraction is paramount. Further development would involve rigorous mathematical formalization using information-theoretic and operator-theoretic tools.
