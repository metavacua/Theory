## Working with this repository

This is a LaTeX thesis repository.

### Directory Structure

- `thesis/`: Main thesis files. The main file is `thesis/main.tex`.
- `papers/`: Standalone papers and other documents, converted to `.tex` format.
- `assets/`: Images, diagrams, and other assets.
- `originals/`: The original, unconverted `.docx`, `.odt`, and `.txt` files.

### LaTeX

- When adding new `.tex` files, please place them in the appropriate directory.
- Ensure that the main thesis file (`thesis/main.tex`) is updated to include any new chapters or sections.
- Keep the repository clean by adding LaTeX auxiliary file extensions to the `.gitignore` file.
- Before submitting, ensure the entire thesis compiles without errors. You can do this by running `pdflatex thesis/main.tex`. You may need to run it multiple times to resolve all cross-references.

Subject: Jules Agent Protocol v1.0

Objective: To provide a systematic, non-negotiable protocol for task execution, self-correction, and knowledge acquisition within this repository. Adherence to this protocol is mandatory for all operations. This protocol is designed to compensate for your known architectural limitations by leveraging the repository's explicit "Knowledge Core" and external tools.

Phase 0: Initialization Mandate (First Run Only)
Objective: To ensure the operational environment is correctly bootstrapped before any other task is undertaken. This phase is executed once at the beginning of the very first session in a new repository clone.

Procedure:
1. Verify Core Directories: You must check for the existence of the following directories at the repository root:
   - `knowledge_core/`
   - `knowledge_core/asts/`
   - `logs/`
   If any are missing, you MUST create them.

2. Verify Core Artifacts: You must check for the existence of the following files. If any are missing, you MUST create them with their default content.
   - `knowledge_core/temporal_orientation.md` (Create with a header indicating it's an auto-generated file).
   - `knowledge_core/symbols.json` (Create as an empty JSON object: `{}`).
   - `knowledge_core/dependency_graph.json` (Create as an empty JSON object: `{}`).
   - `knowledge_core/llms.txt` (Create with a placeholder description).
   - `logs/activity.log.jsonl` (Create as an empty file).
   - `LOGGING_SCHEMA.md` (Create with the standard schema definition).
   - `postmortem.md` (Create with a placeholder header).
   - `README.md` (Create with a standard project overview).

3. Confirmation: Only after confirming or creating all required artifacts may you proceed to Phase 1. This entire initialization process constitutes your first task.

Phase 1: Temporal Orientation (Scheduled & Ad-Hoc)
Mandate for External Awareness: Your internal knowledge base is frozen as of late 2022. You MUST assume it is outdated for all external technologies, libraries, and frameworks. Your primary source of truth for current standards and best practices is the live internet, accessed via your search tools.

Scheduled Orientation Refresh: A separate, automated process (.github/workflows/temporal-orientation-refresh.yml) runs on a recurring basis. This process:

Scans the repository's manifest files (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.) to identify all primary external dependencies.

For each major dependency, uses external search tools to retrieve the latest version number, links to official documentation, and summaries of significant changes since late 2022.

Synthesizes this information into a structured report and overwrites the knowledge_core/temporal_orientation.md artifact. This artifact serves as your cached "map of the present."

Pre-Task Orientation Check: At the beginning of EVERY new task, you must first consult knowledge_core/temporal_orientation.md to understand the current landscape of the technologies relevant to the task.

Phase 2: Deconstruction & Internal Contextualization
Task Ingestion: Receive the user-provided task.

Entity Identification: Identify all candidate code entities (functions, classes, modules, files) relevant to the task description. Perform a direct lookup against the knowledge_core/symbols.json artifact to resolve these candidates to concrete symbols and their exact locations (file path, line number).

Impact Analysis: Using the file paths identified in the previous step as a starting point, construct a dependency impact analysis. Query the knowledge_core/dependency_graph.json artifact to identify all immediate upstream dependents (code that will be affected by changes) and downstream dependencies (code that the target entities rely on). The complete set of all identified files constitutes the "Task Context Set."

Phase 3: Multi-Modal Information Retrieval (RAG)
Structural Retrieval (Internal): For every file in the Task Context Set, retrieve its corresponding Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the knowledge_core/asts/ directory. Use these ASTs to gain a deep, syntactic understanding of function signatures, call sites, data structures, and class hierarchies. This is your primary source for structural reasoning.

Conceptual Retrieval (Internal): Formulate a precise query based on the task description and the names of the primary entities involved. Execute this query against the knowledge_core/llms.txt artifact. This is your primary source for retrieving architectural principles and project-specific domain knowledge (e.g., details of the non-classical logic).

Just-In-Time External RAG: The temporal_orientation.md artifact provides a baseline. However, for the specific APIs or patterns required by the task, you MUST perform a targeted external search using your tools. The goal is to find the most current, official documentation and best-practice examples for the specific versions of the libraries you are working with. Do not rely on your internal knowledge.

Knowledge Synthesis: Consolidate all retrieved information—internal symbols, dependencies, ASTs, project docs, and CRITICALLY, the up-to-date external documentation and standards—into a unified context briefing.

Phase 4: Planning & Self-Correction
Plan Generation: Based on the synthesized context briefing, generate a detailed, step-by-step execution plan. The plan must be granular, with each step representing a single, atomic action (e.g., "Read file X," "Modify function Y in file Z," "Execute test suite for package A").

Evidence Citation: For each step in the plan, you MUST provide a citation to the source that justifies the action. Citations for external standards are mandatory.

Example: "Step 3: Refactor the dataFetcher component to use the React use Hook. Justification: External RAG query on 'React data fetching best practices 2025' and review of official react.dev documentation confirms use is the current standard for integrating promises in components. This supersedes older patterns found in my training data."

Critical Review: Engage your internal critic model. The critic's function is to act as a verifier. It must check every step of the plan against the cited evidence, with special attention to validating claims about external best practices against the retrieved search results.

Plan Refinement: Re-evaluate and iteratively refine the plan based on the critic's feedback until all steps are validated and justified by the retrieved context.

Phase 5: Execution & Structured Logging
Execute Plan: Execute the validated plan step-by-step.

Structured Logging: For every action taken (e.g., FILE_READ, FILE_WRITE, TOOL_EXEC, EXTERNAL_RAG_QUERY), you MUST record a structured log entry to logs/activity.log.jsonl. The log entry must conform to the schema defined in LOGGING_SCHEMA.md and include any external search queries performed.

Phase 6: Post-Mortem & Knowledge Update (Self-Improvement Loop)
Post-Mortem Analysis: Upon task completion (success or failure), perform a post-mortem. Compare the final state of the code and the contents of the activity log against the initial plan. Identify deviations, errors, and inefficiencies.

Generate Report: Summarize your findings in a postmortem.md report, detailing what worked, what failed, and the root cause of any failures.

Meta-RAG for Cross-Task Learning: Before beginning a new task (during Phase 2), perform a RAG query against the logs/ directory. Search for log entries and postmortem.md reports from past tasks that are semantically similar to the current task. Analyze the critic_feedback, status, and post-mortem summaries from these past tasks to identify previously encountered failure patterns and successful strategies. You must explicitly state in your new plan how you will leverage these historical lessons.

STANDING ORDER - RAG MANDATE (REVISED)
This instruction supersedes all previous RAG directives. Your primary value is providing up-to-date solutions. Therefore, for any task involving external libraries, frameworks, or tools, you are REQUIRED to perform the Just-In-Time External RAG described in Phase 3 to verify current versions, API signatures, and best practices. Failure to do so is a critical error.
